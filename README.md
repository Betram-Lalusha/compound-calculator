## Overview

### Description

The website allows visitors to calculate the compound interest on an investment. The site uses the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) to calculate the interest

## How-It-Works

The site uses javascript event listeners to listen for when a user types in one of the input boxes. It then uses the current values in each input box to calculate the compund interest. This interest updates live as the user changes values. If one of the input boxes is empty, the interest is set to 0. 

The progress bar keeps track of how many fields a user has entered. If user has entered a valid number in all fields, the pgress bar will be full.
